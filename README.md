# **5 Days Coding**
## **Tea Recipe**
### **Description**

This is the result of 5 days coding training following up steps and adding my own research to solve the challenge. The final achievement was giving same look as presented by instructor initially using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Being responsive and easy to interact with. 

### **User Stories**
```
As a tea lover user,
I can know how to make a lovely cup of tea 
So I want to read the ingredients and preparation.

As a user,
I want to see an attractive layout with nice picture and clear steps 
So that encourages me to read until ending up.

So I can get a better understanding of what I need to enjoy of my tea.

## **Approach** 

My first step was a research online about technologies which were going to be used in the challenge, applying the skills learnt on daily tasks.

Therefore, having an idea of the user requirements, I have started implementing the website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
